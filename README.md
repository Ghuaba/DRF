- **Django (ASGI)**: Backend server with WebSocket support.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database.
- **Redis**: Used for caching and as the backend for Channels.
- **Docker**: For local development and deployment.

- **PostgreSQL**
- **Docker + Docker Compose**
- **Uvicorn**

###  Important Notes

- The `.env` file **must be inside the `core` folder**. Make sure it's configured correctly.

- **Redis is not working with TLS**, so a non-secure connection is being used. If deploying to production, consider configuring Redis with TLS.

- **Don't forget to check the `DEBUG` variable** in `settings.py`
